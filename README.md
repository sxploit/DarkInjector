# DarkInjector

**DarkInjector** is a Python-based DLL injection tool that allows you to inject dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into running processes. It uses the `pymem` library to manipulate process memory and inject DLLs seamlessly.

## Features
- Injects DLLs into processes by interacting with their memory space.
- Uses `pymem` and `colorama` libraries for process memory manipulation and console output formatting.
- Simple command-line interface.
